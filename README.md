## Prerequisites
We use Python `>3.5`, Flask `1.1.x`, React.js as well as Solidity `>0.5.0` 

### Prerequisites for Developers
Please install `Moesif CORS` to interact with the database and backend from the web browser. 

## Running the Application
### Backend
Please run the following to start the server:

python ksea-token/ksea-token/ranking.py
```

We also have auxiliary files to help you get started building your Database, unless you already have it configured: 
```
python ksea-token/ksea-token/add_test_case.py
```
The above file will dump dummy data that you can interact with.
